# LLaMA-critic
Exploring of an minimal LLaMA LLM model (7B) with Reinforcement Learning Critic method for Fact Checking

**Ideas :** 
  - Environment : Universal Assertion Generator
  - Actor (True/False) : LLaMA (last layer is cut) + Attention Extention
  - Critic : RNN / Attention


This project is based of minimal, hackable and readable example to load [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1)) models and run inference. In order to download the checkpoints and tokenizer, fill this [google form](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5)
